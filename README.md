**Dreamland**

This is a single player game, with zombies that you can shoot or use landmines against. Each zombie killed, contributes to your score!

Game Play: 
1. Projectiles are limited to shoot every 0.3s. 
2. Landmines detonate after 1s of placing them. Landmines can only be placed every 1s.
3. Zombies increase in speed as score gets higher. 
4. Zombies' spawn rate increases as score gets higher. 
5. Zombies move randomly, but changes to the opposite direction every time they hit the window boundary. 
6. Sound effects enabled. 


This game was coded with js and in order to have better animation and transitions, I used the P5 library. 

Some future features I hope to implement: 
1. Player lives
2. Multi player game (local)
3. Stores your high score for next game play
4. More weapons & blockades
